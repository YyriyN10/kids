The fastest way to end this genocide is to make it impossible for Russia to finance it. <br/> <br/>Over 40% of Russia’s government revenue comes from the sale of oil and gas, with Germany its biggest customer. We are, alas, the biggest sponsor of Russia’s invasion after Russia itself. <br/> <br/> It is cynical and callous for us to deliberate how slowly we want to rid ourselves of Russian energy. As we consider what percent of our GDP we are willing to give up, millions of Ukrainians must flee their homes, and thousands are slaughtered, tortured, and raped. It is morally inconceivable to delay further. I urge you to stand on the right side of history and do everything in your power to rid our nation of Russian oil and gas immediately.",
